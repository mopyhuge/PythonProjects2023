# Create a variable named base and set it equal to 10
# Create a variable named height and set it equal to 5.0
# Create an "area" variable and set it equal to the expression "0.5 * base * height".
# This will calculate the area of a triangle. Then print the area to the screen.
# Use the type() and print() functions to print the type of the "area" variable
