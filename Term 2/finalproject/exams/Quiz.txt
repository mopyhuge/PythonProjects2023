Code Knowledge
What does an input statement do
1 allows for more code to be implemented
2 Takes an input from a user and turns it into a value depending on the characters
3 Takes an input from a user as a string
4 allows the user to type and does nothing else
3
A input statement takes input from a user and turns it into a string

2 A statement that asks the user a question
3 I dunno

Basic Knowledge
What kind of language is python
1 Spoken
2 Programing
3 Interpreted
4 Alien
3
Python is an interpreted language
basic Knowledge
what is an interpreted language
1 A language that needs to be translated to binary by the computer
2 A language that can be programed in and then later edited without fail
3 I dunno
4 A language that needs an interpreter program to run
4
An intepreted language needs an interpreter to run, otherwise the computer will not understand the language.
Code logic
How does on define a string

2 They put a set of single quotes around text
3 I dunno
4 They put a set of double quotes around the text
4
to define a string one needs to put double quotes around an object otherwise they might get an error or the will make an undefined variable
Basic Knowledge
Was python built with one use in mind
1 Yes
2 No
3
4
2
Python was not built with only one use in mind
code logic
Why are indents crucial in python
1 they aren't
2 They make th ecode look nice and oganized
3 I dunno
4 Due to the simplicity of the language if the indents are incorect then the interprter will interpret the code wrong resulting in errors
4
Python is very case sensitive when it comes to indents
Basic Knowledge
Booleans always need to be capitalized
1 True
2 False
3
4
1
A boolean will not run if it is not capitalized

2 I dunno
3 Syntax error
4 I dunno
1
Code that dosen't run is a logic error and will not be displayed

4
2
Logic errors will not cause a program to stop
